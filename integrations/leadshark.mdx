## Overview

[LeadShark](https://leadshark.io) is a LinkedIn automation platform that captures leads from your post engagement - comments, likes, and profile visits. By connecting LeadShark to Kakiyo, these engaged leads automatically become prospects in your outreach campaigns.

<Info>
  **Use Case**: You post valuable content on LinkedIn. When someone comments "Interested!" or likes your post, LeadShark captures their profile and Kakiyo automatically adds them to your campaign for personalized AI-powered follow-up.
</Info>

## Prerequisites

- An active or "prospects needed" campaign in Kakiyo

<Tip>
  The secret is used to verify that webhooks are actually coming from LeadShark, not a malicious third party.
</Tip>

---

## Step 8: Activate the Connection

Return to the Kakiyo dashboard. Your connection shows as **Pending** because we need the secret to verify webhooks.

<Check>
  **You're all set!** When someone engages with your LinkedIn content, LeadShark will automatically send their profile to Kakiyo, where they'll be added as prospects to your campaign.
</Check>

---

## What Happens Next?

Once active, the integration works automatically:

1. **Lead Captured** - Someone comments/likes your LinkedIn post
2. **Webhook Sent** - LeadShark sends lead data to Kakiyo
3. **Prospect Created** - Kakiyo adds them to your campaign
4. **AI Outreach** - Your AI agent can follow up with personalized messages

## Managing Connections

From the integration detail page, you can:

- **View Stats** - See how many leads have been captured
- **Edit Settings** - Change the target campaign
- **Copy URL** - Get the webhook URL again
- **Delete** - Remove the connection

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Leads not appearing in campaign">
    1. Check that your connection shows as **Active** (not Pending)
    2. Verify the webhook URL is correctly configured in LeadShark
    3. Ensure your campaign is in **Active** or **Prospects Needed** status
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Webhook signature errors">
    Make sure the secret in Kakiyo exactly matches the secret from LeadShark. Re-copy and paste if needed.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Duplicate leads">
    Kakiyo automatically deduplicates leads by LinkedIn URL. If a lead is already in your campaign, they won't be added again.
  </Accordion>
