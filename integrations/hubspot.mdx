## Overview

[HubSpot](https://www.hubspot.com) is a leading CRM platform for sales, marketing, and customer service. By connecting HubSpot to Kakiyo, your LinkedIn outreach prospects automatically sync to HubSpot as contacts, keeping your CRM up-to-date with all your outreach activities.

<Info>
  **Use Case**: Your AI agent qualifies a prospect on LinkedIn. HubSpot automatically receives their contact information, status updates, timeline events, and even creates deals when prospects are qualified.

### Available Settings

| Setting | Description | Default |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Sync Prospects** | Sync prospect data to HubSpot contacts | On |
| **Sync Timeline** | Create timeline events for status changes | On |
| **Auto-Create Deals** | Automatically create deals when prospects are qualified | Off |
| **Associate Company** | Link contacts to existing HubSpot companies | On |

</Tip>

## How Syncing Works

### Automatic Sync (Status Changes)

When a prospect's status changes in Kakiyo (qualified, unqualified, etc.), the integration automatically:

1. Creates or updates the contact in HubSpot
2. Updates the `kakiyo_status` property
3. Creates a timeline event (if enabled)
4. Creates a deal (if qualified and enabled)

### Manual Bulk Sync

Click the **Sync** button on the integration page to sync all existing prospects to HubSpot at once.

<Warning>
  Bulk sync processes all prospects across all campaigns. For large teams, this may take a few minutes.
</Warning>

---

## Custom Properties in HubSpot

Kakiyo automatically creates these custom contact properties in HubSpot:

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `linkedin_profile_url` | The prospect's LinkedIn profile URL |
| `kakiyo_prospect_id` | Internal Kakiyo ID for reference |
| `kakiyo_campaign` | The campaign name in Kakiyo |
| `kakiyo_status` | Current status (Active, Qualified, Unqualified, etc.) |

You can use these properties to:
- Create HubSpot lists and segments
- Build workflows and automations
- Filter contacts by campaign or status
- Track outreach performance

---

## Integration Stats

The integration page shows real-time statistics:

- **Contacts Synced** - Total new contacts created in HubSpot
- **Timeline Events** - Status change events logged
- **Deals Created** - Deals created for qualified prospects
- **Last Sync** - When the last sync occurred

---

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Prospects not syncing to HubSpot">
    1. Check that your connection shows as **Connected** (green badge)
    2. Verify sync is enabled in settings
    3. Try clicking the **Sync** button for manual sync
    4. Check if the prospect's status has changed (sync triggers on status change)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Token expired error">
    HubSpot tokens expire periodically. Kakiyo automatically refreshes them, but if you see this error:
    1. Disconnect the integration
    2. Reconnect using the same steps above
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Duplicate contacts in HubSpot">
    Kakiyo identifies contacts by LinkedIn URL. If duplicates exist:
    1. The prospect may have been added to HubSpot before the integration
    2. Merge duplicates in HubSpot using their merge tool
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Deals not being created">
    1. Ensure **Auto-Create Deals** is enabled in settings
    2. Deals are only created when prospects are marked as **Qualified**
    3. Check your HubSpot deal pipeline permissions
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Custom properties not appearing">
    Kakiyo creates custom properties automatically on first sync. If they don't appear:
    1. Run a manual sync
    2. Check HubSpot Settings > Properties > Contact Properties
    3. Properties may be in the "Contact Information" group
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Managing the Integration

From the integration detail page, you can:

- **View Stats** - See sync statistics and last sync time
- **Edit Settings** - Change sync preferences
- **Manual Sync** - Trigger a bulk sync of all prospects
- **Disconnect** - Remove the HubSpot connection

<Warning>
  Disconnecting the integration will stop syncing, but won't delete any data already in HubSpot.
</Warning>
