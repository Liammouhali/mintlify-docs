> The HubSpot integration syncs your Kakiyo outreach activity directly into your CRM. Prospects become contacts, conversations become timeline events, and qualified leads can auto-create deals.

## Connecting HubSpot

1. Navigate to **Integrations** in the sidebar.
2. Click **Connect** on the HubSpot card.
3. You will be redirected to HubSpot to authorize Kakiyo with the required permissions (contacts, companies, deals, and timeline access).
4. After authorization, you are redirected back to Kakiyo with the integration active.

Kakiyo automatically creates four custom contact properties in your HubSpot account: `linkedin_profile_url`, `kakiyo_prospect_id`, `kakiyo_campaign`, and `kakiyo_status`.

## What Gets Synced

### Contacts

When a prospect's status changes in Kakiyo, the system finds or creates a matching HubSpot contact by LinkedIn URL. Synced fields include: first name, last name, job title, company, city, country, and LinkedIn URL.

If a contact already exists with the same LinkedIn URL, it is **updated** rather than duplicated.

### Timeline Events

Each status change (invitation sent, accepted, message sent, replied, qualified) creates a **HubSpot Note** on the contact, showing the event type, status transition, and campaign name.

### Company Associations

When enabled, Kakiyo searches for an existing HubSpot company by name and links the contact to it.

### Auto-Create Deals

When enabled and a prospect reaches **Qualified** status, a deal is automatically created in your specified pipeline and stage, associated with the contact.

## Configuration Options

From the HubSpot integration settings page, you can toggle:

- **Sync Prospects** (default: on) - Auto-create HubSpot contacts from Kakiyo prospects
- **Sync Timeline Events** (default: on) - Log LinkedIn activities as HubSpot notes
- **Associate Companies** (default: on) - Link contacts to existing HubSpot companies
- **Auto-Create Deals** (default: off) - Create deals when prospects are qualified

---

## Bulk Sync

You can trigger a manual bulk sync from the integration settings page. This iterates through all campaigns and syncs every prospect to HubSpot. Useful after first connecting or if you need to refresh data.

---

## Token Management

The integration uses OAuth with automatic token refresh. You should not need to re-authenticate unless the refresh token expires or you revoke access from HubSpot. The integration status page shows whether your token is valid and when it expires.
