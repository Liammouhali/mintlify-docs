> Webhooks let you receive real-time HTTP notifications when events occur in your Kakiyo campaigns. Use them to sync data with your CRM, trigger automations, or build custom integrations.

## Available Events

| **Event** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| `linkedin.message.sent` | Agent sends a message to a prospect |
| `linkedin.message.received` | Prospect responds to an agent |
| `linkedin.invitation.sent` | Agent sends a connection invitation |
| `linkedin.invitation.accepted` | Prospect accepts a connection invitation |
| `*` | Wildcard: receive all events |

## Setting Up a Webhook

1. Navigate to **Webhooks** in the sidebar.
2. Click **Create Webhook**.
3. Fill in the configuration:

- **Name**: A label for your webhook (e.g., "CRM Sync")
- **URL**: The HTTPS endpoint that will receive the POST requests
- **Secret** (optional): A shared secret for HMAC signature verification
- **Events**: Select which events to listen for

---

## Payload Format

Every webhook delivery sends a `POST` request with `Content-Type: application/json`:

```

{
  "event": "linkedin.message.received",
  "teamId": "<TEAM_ID>",
  "timestamp": "2025-07-15T10:30:00.000Z",
  "data": {
    "agentId": "...",
    "campaignId": "...",
    "chatId": "...",
    "prospectId": "...",
    "message": "...",
    "timestamp": "..."
  }
}

```

---

## Security: HMAC Signature Verification

If you configure a **secret**, every delivery includes an `X-Kakiyo-Signature` header containing an HMAC-SHA256 signature of the JSON payload. Verify it server-side by computing the same HMAC using your secret over the raw request body.

---

## Retry Logic and Auto-Disable

- Failed deliveries are retried automatically.
- Webhooks can be disabled after repeated failures to protect your integration quality.
- Re-enabling a webhook resets its failure tracking.

---

## Credit Cost

Each successful webhook delivery consumes **2 credits**. Failed deliveries do not consume credits.

---

## Testing

Use the API to test your webhooks before going live:

- `POST /v1/webhooks/test` sends a test payload to all active webhooks for a given event.
- `GET /v1/webhooks/test/example/:event` returns an example payload without triggering anything.
