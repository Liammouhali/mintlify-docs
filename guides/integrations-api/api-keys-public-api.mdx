> The Kakiyo Public API gives you full programmatic access to manage agents, campaigns, prospects, products, prompts, analytics, webhooks, and more. Authenticate with API keys and integrate Kakiyo into your existing workflows.

## Creating an API Key

1. Navigate to **API Keys** in the sidebar.
2. Click **Create API Key**.
3. Enter a name (e.g., "Production CRM Sync").
4. Copy the generated 40-character key immediately. It is shown only once.

> **Security**: Store your API key securely. Never expose it in client-side code or public repositories.

---

## Authentication

All API requests require a Bearer token in the `Authorization` header:

```

Authorization: Bearer YOUR_40_CHARACTER_API_KEY

```

The API validates your key, checks your subscription status, and verifies you have available credits before processing the request.
