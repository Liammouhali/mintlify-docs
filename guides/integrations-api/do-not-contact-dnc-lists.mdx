> Do Not Contact (DNC) lists let you exclude specific LinkedIn profiles from all outreach. Entries are automatically enforced at every stage: prospect import, task scheduling, and message generation.

## Accessing the DNC List

Navigate to **Prospects** in the sidebar, then click the **Do Not Contact** tab.

## Adding Entries

### Manual Entry

1. Click **Add to Do Not Contact**.
2. Enter the LinkedIn profile URL (full URL or just the profile path).
3. For agency teams, optionally select a **Client** to scope the entry.
4. Click **Add**.

URLs are automatically normalized (protocol stripped, lowercased, trailing slashes removed).

### CSV Bulk Import

1. Click the **upload button** to open the bulk import dialog.
2. Drag and drop or select a `.csv` file.
3. The parser automatically detects delimiters and extracts LinkedIn URLs from any column.
4. Results are displayed: entries added, duplicates skipped, and errors.

> **Maximum 1,000 URLs per CSV upload.**

## How DNC Is Enforced

Your DNC list is checked at four critical points in the pipeline:

1. **Prospect import**: Prospects on the DNC list are marked as skipped and not imported.
2. **Task scheduling**: Before assigning invitation or message tasks, the scheduler checks DNC.
3. **Initial message generation**: Before the AI writes a first message.
4. **Reply generation**: Before the AI writes a reply.

Results are cached for 5 minutes per team for performance.

## Agency Subteam Scoping

Agency teams can scope DNC entries to specific clients (subteams). When checking, the system applies both global and client-specific entries. Only teams on the Agency plan can use subteam-scoped DNC.
