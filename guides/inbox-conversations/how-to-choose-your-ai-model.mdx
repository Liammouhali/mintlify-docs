> Selecting the right AI model impacts both conversation quality and credit costs. While it's tempting to choose the cheapest option, the wrong model can hurt your results and waste money through poor performance.

## Why Model Choice Matters

The AI model you select directly affects how intelligent and natural your conversations sound. A cheaper model might save credits per message, but if it generates poor responses that prospects ignore, you're actually wasting money.

Quality conversations lead to better response rates, which means more meetings booked per credit spent. Think of it like hiring an SDR - you could hire the cheapest person available, but if they can't hold good conversations, you'll get terrible results.

## Recommended Starting Point

As of February 2026, **Claude Sonnet 4.5 (Anthropic)** is our recommended default model. It delivers an excellent balance of conversation quality, natural tone, and credit efficiency for LinkedIn outreach.

**Why Claude Sonnet 4.5 works well:**

- Handles complex prospect questions and objections effectively
- Maintains natural, human-sounding conversation flow
- Strong reasoning for personalized responses
- Excellent value relative to credits consumed

<Warning>
Model performance evolves. What's best today may not be best in six months. Treat this as a starting point — re-test periodically and compare against newer models as they become available.

## Model Selection Strategy

**Start with a baseline**: Pick one primary model, launch controlled tests, and compare quality and conversion outcomes before switching.

**Test thoroughly**: Use the Sandbox to ensure AI responses meet your quality standards before launching campaigns.

**Monitor and adjust**: Track these key metrics when switching models:

- Response rates from prospects
- Conversation quality and flow
- Meeting booking success rates
- Overall ROI per campaign

> **Tip**: Sometimes paying more per credit results in better overall ROI through improved conversion rates.

## Optimization Tips

- **Always test new models** in the Sandbox before going live. Pay attention to how the AI handles objections, answers prospect questions, and maintains conversation flow.
- **Track results over time** and be prepared to adjust your model choice as new options become available or as your targeting evolves.
- **Focus on ROI, not just credit costs**. The cheapest model per credit isn't necessarily the cheapest model per booked meeting.

Remember: optimize for overall campaign success rather than just minimizing credit costs. The right model choice can significantly impact your outreach ROI.
