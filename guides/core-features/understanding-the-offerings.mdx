> An offering is your AI agent's knowledge base about what you're selling. It provides the context and information the AI needs to have intelligent conversations with prospects.

## What's in an Offering

Your offering includes:

- **Core value proposition**: What problem you solve and how
- **Unique selling points**: Key features, benefits, and proof points
- **Competitive advantages**: What makes you different
- **Case studies and metrics**: Real results and social proof
- **Target audience context**: Specific messaging for your ideal customers

---

## Why Offerings Matter

> **Separate different offerings:** Never combine multiple products or services in one offering.

Create separate offerings for different:

- Target audiences
- Products or services
- Campaigns or use cases

**Better results:** Focused offerings give the AI exclusive knowledge about what it's selling, leading to much better conversation quality and results.

## Three Ways to Create Offerings

### 1. Website Scraping

**Best for:** Companies with comprehensive websites that clearly explain their solution.

**Process:**

- Provide your website URL
- AI automatically extracts value proposition, features, and benefits
- Quick setup with minimal manual input

> **Limitation:** Not ideal if you have multiple offerings or if your website content isn't comprehensive.

### 2. Smart Builder (5 Questions)

**Best for:** Most businesses wanting detailed, customized offerings.

**Process:**

- Answer 5 strategic questions about your business
- Provide detailed responses (don't be brief - the AI needs substance)
- AI creates comprehensive offering based on your answers

> **Important:** Give detailed answers to each question. Brief responses result in poor offering quality.

### 3. Manual Creation

**Best for:** Businesses with complex offerings or specific messaging requirements.

**Process:**

- Write your offering content manually
- Include all key elements (value prop, USPs, proof points)
- Use "Improve with AI" to optimize formatting and structure

> **Improve with AI:** This feature formats your manual offering so the AI understands it perfectly. Always use this after manual creation.

## Best Practices

### Content Quality

- **Be specific**: Avoid generic language and vague benefits
- **Include proof**: Add metrics, case studies, and concrete results
- **Target relevance**: Tailor messaging to your specific audience
- **Clear value**: Make it obvious why prospects should care

### Testing Your Offering

- **Use the Sandbox**: Test how well your offering performs in conversations
- **Quality check**: Ensure the AI can answer prospect questions accurately
- **Refinement**: Update offerings based on conversation performance

### Multiple Offerings Strategy

- **Audience-specific**: Create different offerings for different target markets
- **Product-specific**: Separate offerings for different products or services
- **Campaign-specific**: Tailor offerings for specific outreach goals

## Common Mistakes

- **Combining offerings**: Mixing multiple products in one offering
- **Brief responses**: Not providing enough detail in Smart Builder questions
- **Generic content**: Using vague, non-specific language
- **Skipping optimization**: Not using "Improve with AI" for manual offerings

---

> Your offering is the foundation of effective AI conversations. Invest time in creating detailed, focused offerings for each target audience and product.
