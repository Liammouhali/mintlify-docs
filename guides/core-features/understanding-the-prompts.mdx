> Prompts define how your AI agent behaves and communicates. Kakiyo uses a two-layer prompt system that gives you complete control over conversation style and strategy.

## Two-Layer Prompt System

### Context Prompt

Defines your AI agent's behavior, personality, and conversation strategy.

**Includes:**

- Agent's role and personality
- Conversation goals and objectives
- Tone and communication style
- Limits and boundaries
- Fallback behaviors and responses

### First Message Prompt

Defines how conversations are opened after connection acceptance.

**Includes:**

- Opening message structure
- Value proposition delivery
- Personalization approach
- Call-to-action strategy

---

## Variable System

Variables allow you to reuse prompts across multiple campaigns and agents with different parameters.

### Required Variables

Must be configured for every campaign:

- **Prospect Description**: All prospect information for personalization
- **Offering Description**: Knowledge about what you're selling

> Important: you don't need to enter a value for those variables, just place them somewhere in one of your 2 prompts and let the AI Agent fill them for you.

### Optional Variables

Pre-defined variables for common use cases:

- **Agent Name**: Name the AI should use in conversations
- **Company**: Your company name for the campaign
- **Prospect Name**: How to address prospects

### Custom Variables

Create your own variables for specific needs:

- **Goal**: Different objectives for different campaigns
- **Industry**: Specific messaging for different sectors
- **Custom messaging**: Any other variable content you need

> **Example usage:** You want to use the same prompt in 2 different campaigns.
>
> Instead of writing "Your objective is to book a meeting" in the prompt, use "Your objective is to {{goal}}" and set Goal = "book a meeting" in Campaign 1 and Goal = "visit my website" in Campaign 2.

## AI Model Selection

Kakiyo offers access to all major AI models from leading providers:

**Available Models:**

- **Anthropic Models**: All Claude models (Sonnet and Opus)
- **OpenAI Models**: All GPT models (ChatGPT series)
- **Grok Models**: All X AI models
- **Google Models**: All Gemini models

**Recommendation:** As of February 2026, **Claude Sonnet 4.5 (Anthropic)** offers an excellent balance of conversation quality and credit efficiency for outreach use cases. Start there, then optimize based on Sandbox and live campaign metrics.

<Warning>
The best-performing model changes over time. Re-test your default model regularly and adjust based on actual outcomes rather than assumptions.
</Warning>

## Credit System

Credits are consumed only when the AI agent sends messages during conversations. No credits are used for setup, testing, or other platform activities.

**Credit consumption is per message and depends on:**

- **AI model selected**: Different models have different costs
- **Prompt size**: Length and complexity of your prompts
- **Message length**: Length of the AI-generated response

> **Variable consumption:** Credit usage varies significantly per message depending on these factors. There's no fixed rate as it depends entirely on your specific configuration and conversation context.

## Writing Effective Prompts

### Best Practices

- **Define clear goals**: Specify exactly what you want the AI to achieve
- **Set boundaries**: Define what the AI should and shouldn't do
- **Match your tone**: Write in the style you want the AI to use
- **Include fallback instructions**: Tell the AI how to handle unexpected situations
- **Use proper formatting**: Structure prompts clearly with sections

### Testing and Optimization

- **Use the Sandbox**: Test prompt effectiveness before launching campaigns
- **Iterate based on results**: Refine prompts based on conversation performance
- **Monitor conversations**: Review actual AI responses and adjust accordingly

---

### Starting Point

Kakiyo provides a default prompt template to help you launch quickly. Use it as a baseline, then iterate based on your own audience and campaign results.

> **Important**: Reply performance depends on targeting quality, profile quality, and prompt quality. Validate improvements with controlled tests instead of assumptions.

Well-crafted prompts are essential for successful AI conversations. Start with the default template and refine based on your specific audience and goals.
