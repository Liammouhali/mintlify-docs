> Campaigns bring together your offering, prompts, LinkedIn profile, and prospects into an active outreach operation. Each campaign targets a specific audience with a specific message.

## Campaign Components

Every campaign requires:

- **Offering**: What you're selling
- **Prompts**: Context and First Message prompts
- **LinkedIn Profile**: Account that will send messages
- **Prospects**: Target audience (CSV or AI Lead Finder)

---

## Operation Modes

### Autopilot Mode

- **Fully automated**: AI handles all conversations independently
- **No intervention**: Operates 24/7 without human input
- **End-to-end**: Manages from connection to meeting booking
- **Scalable**: Handles multiple conversations simultaneously

### Copilot Mode

- **Human oversight**: Option to review and intervene
- **Pause control**: Take manual control of specific conversations
- **Strategic input**: Combine AI efficiency with human expertise
- **Flexible**: Switch between modes as needed

## Performance Tracking

### Key Metrics

- **Connection Rate**: Percentage of invitations accepted
- **Reply Rate**: Percentage of prospects who respond
- **Prospect Counts**: Total prospects, accepted connections

### Monitoring Options

- **Campaign-specific**: Performance data per campaign
- **Overall averages**: Aggregated performance across all campaigns
- **Profile analytics**: Performance per LinkedIn account

---

### A/B Testing

**No built-in A/B testing**: Create separate campaigns to test different approaches:

- **Different prompts**: Test various conversation strategies
- **Different offerings**: Compare messaging effectiveness
- **Different targeting**: Test audience segments

---

### Best Practices

#### Campaign Strategy

- **Single focus**: One offering per campaign for clarity
- **Clear targeting**: Specific audience segments
- **Consistent messaging**: Aligned prompts and offerings
- **Regular monitoring**: Track performance and adjust

#### Optimization

- **Test before scale**: Validate approach in small batches (~150 prospects)
- **Monitor conversations**: Review AI performance regularly
- **Iterate based on data**: Adjust based on results
- **Multiple campaigns**: Test different approaches simultaneously

#### Safety Considerations

- **Respect limits**: Stay within LinkedIn outreach guidelines (maximum recommended: 30-40 invites per day)
- **Monitor account health**: Watch for any issues or restrictions
- **Gradual scaling**: Increase volume progressively

> Effective campaign management combines strategic setup with ongoing optimization to maximize outreach results while maintaining account safety.
