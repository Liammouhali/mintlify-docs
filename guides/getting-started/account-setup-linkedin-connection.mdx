## Location Settings - Critical Configuration

### Why Location Matters?

Your location setting determines the region used for account operations. This is crucial for:

- **Account security**: Matching your actual geographical location
- **LinkedIn compliance**: Avoiding suspicious login patterns
- **Operational consistency**: Reducing unusual access patterns

### Location Selection Rules

**Choose the closest available location to where you're physically located:**

- **Same country**: Always select your actual country if available
- **Never random**: Never select a random location for convenience, if your country doesn't appear in the list, please contact the support team

### If Your Location Isn't Available

**Contact Kakiyo Support** if your location isn't in the dropdown menu:

1. **Don't guess**: Avoid selecting any random location
2. **Reach out first**: Contact support before making any selection
3. **Explain your situation**: Provide your actual location
4. **Wait for guidance**: Support will either add your location or suggest the best alternative

> **Why this matters**: Correct location setup improves account consistency and helps avoid avoidable connection issues.
