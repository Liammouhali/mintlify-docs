> Setting up your first campaign manually gives you complete control over every aspect of your outreach. This process is essential if you're not using the AI Builder, which automatically creates campaigns for you.

## Campaign Requirements

To create a campaign, you need four essential components:

1. **Offering**: Defines what you're selling and gives the AI knowledge about your solution
2. **Prompt**: Both Context Prompt and First Message Prompt must be created
3. **LinkedIn Account**: At least one connected LinkedIn profile for sending messages
4. **Prospect List**: Either CSV import or AI Lead Finder

## Campaign Creation

### Basic Setup

1. Go to Campaigns -> Create New Campaign
2. **Select Offering**: Choose which offering to promote
3. **Select Prompts**: Choose your Context and First Message prompts
4. **Assign LinkedIn Profile**: Select which account will send messages
5. **Configure Variables**: Set up the variables (if you have some in your prompt)

**Lead credit packs:**
