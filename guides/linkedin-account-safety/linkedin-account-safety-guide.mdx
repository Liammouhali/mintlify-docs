> Keep your LinkedIn account safe while maximizing outreach effectiveness. Follow these guidelines to avoid restrictions and maintain long-term account health.

## Critical Safety Limits

### Daily Invitation Limits

- **Maximum safe limit**: 40 invitations per day
- **Recommended range**: 30-40 invitations daily
- **Risk threshold**: Above 40 invitations increases account restriction risk significantly
- **Never exceed**: Going above 40 can trigger LinkedIn security measures

### Monthly Compliance

- **LinkedIn limit**: 800 invitations per month maximum
- **Kakiyo enforcement**: Automatic compliance with monthly limits
- **Account protection**: Built-in safeguards prevent limit violations

---

## Progressive Scaling Strategy

### Start Conservative

**New accounts should begin slowly:**

- **First 3 days**: 15-20 invitations per day
- **3-7 days**: 25-30 invitations per day
- **After 7 days**: 30-40 invitations per day

### Scaling Factors

- **Account age**: Older, established accounts can scale faster
- **Account activity**: Accounts with existing connections scale better
- **Response rates**: Good engagement allows for confident scaling
- **Monitor response**: Watch for any LinkedIn warnings or restrictions

---

## Location and Infrastructure Safety

### Critical Location Setup

- **Accurate location**: Always use your real geographical location
- **Never random**: Selecting wrong location can trigger security measures
- **Region consistency**: Keep your operational region aligned with your real location
- **Contact support**: If your location isn't available, contact support immediately

### Automatic Protection

- **Managed runtime**: Account activity runs in a controlled environment
- **Activity pacing**: Built-in pacing helps avoid aggressive behavior patterns
- **No device dependency**: Account operates safely without your computer running
- **Human behavior simulation**: Natural timing and interaction patterns

---

## Emergency Protocols

### If Account Issues Arise

- **Stop immediately**: Pause all campaigns and outreach
- **Contact support**: Reach out to Kakiyo support with details
- **Document issues**: Screenshot any LinkedIn warnings or restrictions
- **Wait for guidance**: Don't attempt fixes without support guidance

### Prevention Measures

- **Stay within limits**: Never exceed 40 invitations per day
- **Quality over quantity**: Focus on better targeting rather than volume
- **Natural progression**: Avoid sudden increases in activity
- **Regular monitoring**: Check account health consistently
