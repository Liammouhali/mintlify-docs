> If you encounter issues connecting your LinkedIn account to Kakiyo, follow these troubleshooting steps to resolve common problems safely.

## Invalid Credentials Error

### What This Means

> You've entered incorrect login information (email or password).

### Resolution Steps

1. **Verify your credentials**:  - Double-check your LinkedIn email address - Confirm your password is correct - Remove any extra spaces or characters
2. **Reset if uncertain**:  - Change your LinkedIn password to be completely certain - Use the new password when connecting to Kakiyo
3. **Retry connection**:  - Enter the verified credentials in Kakiyo - Attempt connection again

### Important Warning

> **Maximum 2 attempts**: Never retry more than twice if you continue getting "Invalid Credentials"

**After 2 failed attempts**: Contact Kakiyo support immediately. Multiple failed attempts can trigger LinkedIn security measures that may put your account at risk.

## Authentication Needed

### What This Means

> LinkedIn requires 2 factors authentication verification for the login attempt.

### Two Verification Methods

**Email Code:**

- LinkedIn sends a verification code to your email
- Check your inbox (and spam folder)
- Enter the code when prompted

**Mobile App Verification:**

- LinkedIn requests approval via mobile app
- Open LinkedIn mobile app
- Approve the login attempt

### Critical Timing

- **2-minute window**: You have approximately 2 minutes to complete verification
- **Be ready**: Have your email and mobile device accessible before starting

### If Verification Fails

> **Contact support immediately**: If you don't receive the email code or mobile verification request, contact Kakiyo support.

**Not our limitation**: Kakiyo cannot control LinkedIn's verification system. The verification request comes directly from LinkedIn.

## Other Connection Issues

### Persistent Problems

If your connection remains stuck or you encounter other unexpected issues:

1. **Don't keep retrying**: Multiple attempts can trigger security measures
2. **Contact support**: Reach out to Kakiyo support with details about the specific error
3. **Provide context**: Include any error messages or unusual behavior

### Best Practices

**Before Connecting:**

- Ensure you have the correct credentials
- Have access to your email and mobile device
- Set aside sufficient time for the process

**During Connection:**

- Work quickly during verification steps
- Don't navigate away from the connection page
- Complete the process in one session

**If Problems Occur:**

- Stop after 2 failed credential attempts
- Contact support rather than continuing to retry
- Provide detailed information about the error

## When to Contact Support

- Invalid credentials error after 2 attempts

**What to include when contacting support:**

> Account security is paramount. When in doubt, contact support rather than risk triggering LinkedIn's security measures through repeated failed attempts.
