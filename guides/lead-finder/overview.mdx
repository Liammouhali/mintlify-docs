Discover and import high-quality prospects using AI-powered search filters, lead previews, and campaign-ready imports.

## What You Can Do

- Describe your ICP in plain language and let AI propose filters.
- Refine filters manually by title, region, seniority, company data, and signals.
- Preview leads before import and remove any that do not fit.
- Import selected leads directly into campaigns with duplicate checks.

## Credits and Billing

- Lead Finder uses **Lead Credits**, separate from AI conversation credits.
- Current lead credit pack pricing is documented in [Billing and Credits](/guides/team-billing/billing-and-credits).
