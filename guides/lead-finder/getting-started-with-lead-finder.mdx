> Lead Finder uses AI to help you discover and import high-quality prospects from LinkedIn. Describe your ideal customer in plain language, and the AI builds precise search filters for you.

## How Lead Finder Works

Lead Finder is a two-panel studio interface:

- **Left panel (Filter Panel)**: Visual representation of all active search filters, organized into Person, Company, Experience, and Signals categories.
- **Right panel (AI Chat)**: A conversational interface where you describe your ideal customer and the AI suggests filters.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Create a Lead Finder

Navigate to **Lead Finder** in the sidebar and click **Add Lead Finder**. You can also create one directly from a campaign card.

### Step 2: Define Your Filters

You have two options:

- **AI Chat**: Describe your ideal customer in natural language (e.g., "VPs of Marketing at B2B SaaS companies with 50-200 employees in the US"). The AI proposes filters that you can accept or reject.
- **Manual filters**: Add filters directly in the Filter Panel by selecting categories and values.

You can also click **Generate ICP from my offer** to let the AI analyze one of your existing products and auto-generate filters.

### Step 3: Accept or Reject AI Suggestions

When the AI proposes filters, a "Filter Changes" card appears in the chat showing what will change (additions in green, modifications in amber, removals in red). You must either:

- **Apply Changes**: Accept the proposed filters.
- **Reject**: Provide feedback on what to change, and the AI will propose new filters.

### Step 4: Launch

Click **Launch** to open the configuration modal where you choose:

- **Search mode**: Realtime (fresh LinkedIn data, all filters supported) or Database (faster and cheaper, some signal filters unavailable).
- **Number of leads**: Use the slider to select how many leads to fetch (25-1,000 for Realtime, 100-1,000 for Database).
- **Campaign**: Select which campaign to import leads into.

### Step 5: Preview and Import

After fetching completes, you see a preview of all matching leads with their name, headline, company, and location. All leads are selected by default. Deselect any you do not want, then click **Import to Campaign**.

During import, leads are automatically checked for duplicates and Do Not Contact list matches.

## Search Modes and Credit Costs

Lead Finder uses **Lead Credits** (separate from your AI Credits).

| **Mode** | **Cost** | **Speed** | **Filters** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Realtime | 5 credits per lead | Slower (live search) | All filters supported |
| Database | 3 credits per 100 leads | Fast (indexed data) | Signal filters unavailable |

Your current lead credit balance is displayed in the top-right corner of the studio. The launch modal shows the exact credit cost based on your selected quantity.

> Pricing and credit usage displayed in-app should be treated as the latest source of truth.

## Fetch More Leads

After a search completes, you can fetch additional leads without creating a new Lead Finder. From the finished view, use the **Fetch More** slider to select how many additional leads to retrieve. The search resumes from where the previous run left off, and new leads are deduplicated against existing ones.

## Refine and Duplicate

- **Refine Search**: Reset a finished Lead Finder back to draft mode to adjust filters and re-launch.
- **Duplicate**: Create a copy of a Lead Finder with the same filters but fresh state.
