## Overview

Kakiyo API uses API keys for authentication. All API requests must be authenticated using your API key in the Authorization header.

## API Keys

API keys are 40-character strings that should be copied from dashboard

## Obtaining an API Key

You can generate API keys from your Kakiyo dashboard:

1. Log in to your [Kakiyo dashboard](https://app.kakiyo.com)
2. Navigate to **Team > API Keys**
3. Click **Create New API Key**
4. Give your key a descriptive name (e.g., "Production", "Development", "Testing")
5. Copy your newly generated API key immediately, as you won't be able to see it again

<Warning>
  API keys grant access to your Kakiyo account and all associated data. Keep your keys secure and never share them publicly.
</Warning>

## Using Your API Key

Include your API key in the Authorization header of all API requests:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer API_KEY
```

## API Key Best Practices

1. **Never expose your API keys** in client-side code, public repositories, or anywhere else that is publicly accessible.

2. **Use different keys for different environments** (development, staging, production).

3. **Rotate your keys periodically** for security. You can generate new keys and deprecate old ones from your dashboard.

4. **Set appropriate permissions** for each key based on what it needs to access.

5. **Monitor API key usage** to detect unusual patterns that might indicate a security breach.

## Verifying Authentication

You can verify your API key is working correctly by making a simple request to the verification endpoint:

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl -X GET "https://api.kakiyo.com/v1/verify" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

```javascript JavaScript
const axios = require('axios');

const API_KEY = 'YOUR_API_KEY';
const BASE_URL = 'https://api.kakiyo.com/v1';

async function verifyApiKey() {
  try {
    const response = await axios.get(
      `${BASE_URL}/verify`,
      {
        headers: {
          'Authorization': `Bearer ${API_KEY}`,
        }
      }
    );

    console.log('Authentication successful:', response.data);
    return response.data;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Authentication failed:', error.response ? error.response.data : error.message);
    throw error;
  }
}

verifyApiKey();
```

```python Python
import requests

API_KEY = 'YOUR_API_KEY'
BASE_URL = 'https://api.kakiyo.com/v1'

def verify_api_key():
    try:
        response = requests.get(
            f'{BASE_URL}/verify',
            headers={
                'Authorization': f'Bearer {API_KEY}'
            }
        )

        response.raise_for_status()
        print('Authentication successful:', response.json())
        return response.json()
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        print('Authentication failed:', e)
        raise

verify_api_key()
```
</CodeGroup>

If successful, you'll receive a response like:

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "API key is valid"
}
```

## Managing API Keys

You can manage your API keys from the Kakiyo dashboard:

- **View all active keys**: See a list of all your active API keys and when they were last used
- **Create new keys**: Generate new API keys with specific permissions
- **Delete keys**: Revoke access for keys that are no longer needed or may have been compromised

## Error Responses

If authentication fails, you'll receive one of the following error responses:

| Status Code | Error | Description |
| ----------- | ----- | ----------- |
| 401 | `missing_api_key` | No API key was provided in the request |
| 401 | `invalid_api_key_format` | The API key format is invalid |
| 401 | `invalid_api_key` | The API key is not recognized |
| 403 | `subscription_inactive` | Your subscription is inactive |

## Next Steps

Now that you understand how to authenticate with the Kakiyo API, you can proceed to make API calls to create campaigns, add prospects, and more.
