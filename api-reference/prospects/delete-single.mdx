## Pre-Deletion Checklist

Before deleting a prospect, consider:

1. **Export Data**: Save important conversation history
2. **Pause Prospect**: Stop active outreach activities
3. **Check Qualification**: Verify if prospect was qualified
4. **Update CRM**: Sync status with external systems
5. **Team Notification**: Inform relevant team members

## Cascade Deletion Details

When a prospect is deleted, the following data is automatically removed:

### Prospect Data
- Profile information and LinkedIn data
- Additional fields and enrichment data
- Contact information and preferences

### Conversations
- All chat records and message history
- AI-generated responses and templates
- Response tracking and engagement metrics

### Tasks
- Scheduled outreach tasks
- Follow-up reminders
- Automation triggers

### Analytics
- Individual prospect performance data
- Engagement metrics and activity logs
- Qualification tracking data

### Campaign Statistics
Campaign statistics are automatically updated to reflect the deletion:
- Total prospects count decreased
- Message counts adjusted
- Qualification metrics recalculated

## Best Practices

1. **Data Export**: Always export critical data before deletion
2. **Batch Processing**: For multiple deletions, use bulk delete endpoint
3. **Audit Trail**: Keep records of deleted prospects for compliance
4. **Alternative Actions**: Consider pausing instead of deleting
5. **Team Communication**: Notify team members of deletions

## Alternative Actions

Instead of deletion, consider these alternatives:

### Pause Prospect
```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.kakiyo.com/v1/prospects/prospect_123/pause" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

### Disqualify Prospect
```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.kakiyo.com/v1/prospects/prospect_123/disqualify" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

### Move to Different Campaign
Use the campaign update endpoint to transfer the prospect to another campaign while preserving data.

## Recovery Options

<Info>
**No Recovery Available**: Once a prospect is deleted, it cannot be recovered. To restore functionality:
- Re-add the prospect to the campaign
- Restart the conversation from the beginning
- Rebuild any custom data or notes
</Info>

## Bulk Operations

For deleting multiple prospects, use the bulk deletion endpoint:
- More efficient for large operations
- Better error handling for partial failures
- Detailed results for each deletion attempt

## Integration Considerations

When integrating prospect deletion:

1. **Webhook Events**: Deletion triggers webhook events if configured
2. **CRM Sync**: Update external CRM systems accordingly
3. **Analytics Impact**: Consider impact on historical analytics
4. **Automation Rules**: Update any automation rules referencing the prospect
