## Overview

Get a list of available webhook event types that can be used for testing. This endpoint returns all supported webhook events with their identifiers and descriptions, useful for webhook configuration and testing.

## Use Cases

- **Webhook Setup**: Discover available event types during webhook configuration
- **Testing Preparation**: Identify which events to test for your integration
- **Documentation**: Reference event types for webhook development
- **Validation**: Verify supported events before creating webhooks

## Response Structure

The response includes an array of available webhook events with their details:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "prospect.qualified",
    "name": "Prospect Qualified",
    "description": "Triggered when a prospect is marked as qualified",
    "category": "prospect"
  },
  {
    "id": "prospect.responded",
    "name": "Prospect Responded", 
    "description": "Triggered when a prospect responds to outreach",
    "category": "prospect"
  },
  {
    "id": "campaign.completed",
    "name": "Campaign Completed",
    "description": "Triggered when a campaign reaches completion",
    "category": "campaign"
  },
  {
    "id": "agent.status_changed",
    "name": "Agent Status Changed",
    "description": "Triggered when an agent's status changes",
    "category": "agent"
  },
  {
    "id": "message.sent",
    "name": "Message Sent",
    "description": "Triggered when a message is sent to a prospect",
    "category": "message"
  },
  {
    "id": "connection.accepted",
    "name": "Connection Accepted",
    "description": "Triggered when a LinkedIn connection is accepted",
    "category": "connection"
  }
]
```

## Testing Example

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.kakiyo.com/v1/webhooks/test/events" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

```javascript
// JavaScript/Node.js
const getTestEvents = async () => {
  const response = await fetch('https://api.kakiyo.com/v1/webhooks/test/events', {
    method: 'GET',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY',
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    }
  });

  return await response.json();
};

// Usage example
const events = await getTestEvents();
console.log('Available Test Events:', events);

// Filter events by category
const prospectEvents = events.filter(event => event.category === 'prospect');
console.log('Prospect Events:', prospectEvents);
```

```python
# Python
import requests

def get_test_events():
    """Get list of available webhook test events"""
    response = requests.get(
        'https://api.kakiyo.com/v1/webhooks/test/events',
        headers={
            'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY',
            'Content-Type': 'application/json'
        }
    )
    
    return response.json()

# Usage example
events = get_test_events()
print('Available Test Events:', events)

# Group events by category
from collections import defaultdict
events_by_category = defaultdict(list)
for event in events:
    events_by_category[event['category']].append(event)

for category, category_events in events_by_category.items():
    print(f"\n{category.title()} Events:")
    for event in category_events:
        print(f"  - {event['id']}: {event['name']}")
```

## Integration Examples

### Event Selection for Webhook Creation
```javascript
const createWebhookWithEvents = async (url, selectedEventIds) => {
  // First, get available events to validate selection
  const availableEvents = await getTestEvents();
  const validEventIds = availableEvents.map(event => event.id);
  
  // Validate selected events
  const invalidEvents = selectedEventIds.filter(id => !validEventIds.includes(id));
  if (invalidEvents.length > 0) {
    throw new Error(`Invalid event IDs: ${invalidEvents.join(', ')}`);
  }
  
  // Create webhook with validated events
  const response = await fetch('https://api.kakiyo.com/v1/webhooks', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY',
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      name: 'My Integration Webhook',
      url: url,
      events: selectedEventIds
    })
  });
  
  return await response.json();
};
```

### Dynamic Event Configuration
```python
def configure_webhook_events(webhook_url, categories=None):
    """Configure webhook with events from specific categories"""
    events = get_test_events()
    
    if categories:
        # Filter events by categories
        selected_events = [
            event['id'] for event in events 
            if event['category'] in categories
        ]
    else:
        # Use all events
        selected_events = [event['id'] for event in events]
    
    # Create webhook with selected events
    webhook_data = {
        'name': 'Auto-configured Webhook',
        'url': webhook_url,
        'events': selected_events
    }
    
    response = requests.post(
        'https://api.kakiyo.com/v1/webhooks',
        json=webhook_data,
        headers={
            'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY',
            'Content-Type': 'application/json'
        }
    )
    
    return response.json()

# Usage: Configure webhook for prospect and campaign events only
result = configure_webhook_events(
    'https://myapp.com/webhooks/kakiyo',
    categories=['prospect', 'campaign']
)
```

## Best Practices

1. **Event Selection**: Choose only the events your application needs
2. **Category Filtering**: Use categories to organize event subscriptions
3. **Validation**: Always validate event IDs before webhook creation
4. **Documentation**: Keep a reference of event types for your team
5. **Testing**: Use this endpoint to plan your webhook testing strategy

## Next Steps

After getting the list of test events:

1. **Select Events**: Choose relevant events for your integration
2. **Get Examples**: Use `/webhooks/test/example/{event}` to see payload examples
3. **Create Webhook**: Create webhook with selected events
4. **Test Integration**: Use `/webhooks/test` to send test events
5. **Monitor**: Set up monitoring for webhook delivery and processing
