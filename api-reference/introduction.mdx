## Overview

The Kakiyo API is organized around [REST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer). Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts JSON-encoded request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.

## Base URL

All API requests should be made to:

```
https://api.kakiyo.com/v1
```

## Authentication

The Kakiyo API uses API keys to authenticate requests. You can view and manage your API keys in the Kakiyo dashboard.

Authentication is performed via the `Authorization` header with a Bearer token:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TEAM_ID+YOUR_API_KEY
```

All API requests must be made over HTTPS. Calls made over plain HTTP will fail. API requests without authentication will also fail.

## Request Format

For `POST` and `PUT` requests, the request body should be JSON, with the `Content-Type` header set to `application/json`.

```bash
Content-Type: application/json
```

## Response Format

All responses are returned in JSON format. Successful responses include a `200 OK` status code and the appropriate response data.

Example successful response:

```json
{
  "id": "campaign_123456789",
  "name": "Summer Outreach Campaign",
  "status": "active"
}
```

## Error Handling

Kakiyo uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. In general:

- `2xx` range indicates success
- `4xx` range indicates an error occurred based on the information provided (e.g., missing required parameters, invalid API key)
- `5xx` range indicates an error with Kakiyo's servers

All error responses include a JSON object with the following structure:

```json
{
  "error": "error_code",
  "message": "A human-readable description of the error"
}
```

### Common Error Codes

| Status Code | Error Code | Description |
| ----------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| 400 | `validation_error` | The request parameters failed validation |
| 401 | `missing_api_key` | No API key was provided |
| 401 | `invalid_api_key_format` | The API key format is invalid |
| 401 | `invalid_api_key` | The API key is not recognized |
| 403 | `forbidden` | The API key doesn't have permissions to perform the request |
| 403 | `subscription_inactive` | Your subscription is inactive |
| 404 | `not_found` | The requested resource doesn't exist |
| 429 | `rate_limit_exceeded` | Too many requests hit the API too quickly |
| 500 | `internal_error` | Something went wrong on Kakiyo's end |

## Rate Limiting

The API is rate limited to prevent abuse. Rate limits vary based on your subscription plan. If you exceed the rate limit, you'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response.

The response headers will include:

- `X-RateLimit-Limit`: The maximum number of requests allowed in a time window
- `X-RateLimit-Remaining`: The number of requests remaining in the current time window
- `X-RateLimit-Reset`: The time at which the current rate limit window resets (UTC epoch seconds)

When you exceed the rate limit, the response will include a `Retry-After` header indicating how many seconds to wait before retrying.

## Pagination

For endpoints that return lists of items, Kakiyo uses cursor-based pagination. These endpoints accept the following parameters:

- `limit`: The number of items to return (default: 20, maximum: 100)
- `after`: The cursor to use as the starting point for the next set of results

The response will include:

- `data`: The list of items
- `has_more`: A boolean indicating if there are more items available
- `next_cursor`: A cursor to use for the next page of results (only included if `has_more` is true)

Example:

```json
{
  "data": [
    { "id": "campaign_1", "name": "First Campaign" },
    { "id": "campaign_2", "name": "Second Campaign" }
  ],
  "has_more": true,
  "next_cursor": "campaign_2"
}
```

To fetch the next page, include the `next_cursor` value in the `after` parameter:

```
GET /v1/campaigns?limit=2&after=campaign_2
```

## Versioning

The Kakiyo API is versioned. The current version is `v1`. We recommend specifying a version in the URL to ensure API stability for your application.

When we make backwards-incompatible changes to the API, we'll release a new version. We'll provide ample notice before deprecating any API versions.

## Resources
